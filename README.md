The Odin Project: Web Development 101

This project creates an etch-a-sketch like program whereby the grid is filled in when the mouse hovers over each square.

I have made a focus on readable code and keeping variables inside functions. This was an interesting project which taught me how to use event handlers for clicks on buttons, mousing over divs and using the DOM to create and remove the grid used for sketching.
